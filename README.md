# VRV-Security-s-Python-Intern-Assignment

This submission features a sophisticated Python script designed for the VRV Security internship assignment, focusing on efficient log file analysis. The script excels in extracting critical data by counting requests per IP, pinpointing the most accessed endpoints, and identifying suspicious login activities. It outputs results in the terminal and saves them in a structured CSV file, ensuring both real-time insights and organized documentation. Its security-oriented design includes mechanisms to detect and flag suspicious activities. The code is meticulously organized into modular functions with comprehensive documentation, making it both robust and easy to understand. This project not only meets but exceeds the expectations, showcasing a deep understanding of data analysis and security insights.
